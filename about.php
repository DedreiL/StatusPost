	<h1>About</h1>
	<h2>Special Features</h2>
	<p><ul>
		<li type="disc">I changed the system's name to "What's Your Status".</li>
		<li type="disc">My email link on the home page is a live link so when clicked it opens outlook to send an email to me.</li>
		<li type="disc">I tried to make a self generated Status Code that provides the next available code so 
						that the user doesn't have to constantly try and guess the next avaialable code. <br> 
						I managed to get it to work but then the data base has to be set up with a first status code,
						knowing that when I submit my assignment it will be tested on an empty <br>database this would not 
						have worked for my assignment purpose.</li>
		<li type="disc">I made all the links to the other pages display as buttons.</li>	
		<li type="disc">I think I added some nice styling to the page.</li>
        <li type="disc">I added a "Search another status" button to the status search results page</li>
		<li type="disc">I added a "Post a status" button to the status search page</li>
		</ul></p>
	
	<h2>Trouble Areas</h2>
	<p><ul>
		<li type="disc">I had slight trouble with the regular expression, it took some time to get it right</li>
		<li type="disc">I found what took the most time was looking up SQL statement syntax.</li>
        <li type="disc">Overall I didn't have too many trouble areas, my data base connection worked the first time<br>
						aswell as writing too and reading from the database.</li>
		</ul></p>
	
	<h2>Improvements</h2>
	<p><ul>
		<li type="disc">I will make the a self generated Status Code that provides the next available code.</li>
		<li type="disc">I will make sure I do better error handeling from the start I realised I my code allowed for many errors when I had someone else test my pages.</li>
		<li type="disc">I added appropriate error handeling after user experience testing.</li>
		</ul></p>

	<h2>Learnings</h2>
	<p><ul>
        <li type="disc">A lot of what was implemented in the assignment we have learnt in class and in the labs. I found that I got a lot of practical experience now of what we have learnt.</li>
		<li type="disc">I learnt the value in user testing to ensure there were minimal bugs and that the interface has good user experience.</li>
		<li type="disc">I learnt how easy it is to integrate the datbase using php and how powerful it is to make a dynamic website.</li>
		<li type="disc">I discoverd how much I enjoyed doing this web development assignment and I'm very interested in learning more skills.</li>
